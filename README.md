# Concepts of Programming Languages

This repository contains a semester work on the [comparison of distributed programming in Go and Kotlin](./compare-go-distributed-programming-with-kotlin.adoc). In addition, the [go-examples](./go-examples) and [kotlin-examples](./kotlin-examples) folders contain some code samples that were used in the work.

> GitHub prevents code snippets from being included in AsciiDocs. Therefore, it is recommended to check out the repository and view the document locally using an AsciiDoc editor.
